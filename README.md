# Realtime Message Board 

A one page static site built with HTML, CSS, and javascript. Allows any and everyone to drop messages for all to see. 
Simple CRUD can be performed, and data is persistent using Firebase's realtime database for data storage.

You can try it out, as it is hosted [on github pages](https://daviddivinefavour.github.io/realtime_messageboard/) ðŸ™ƒ
